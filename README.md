# Unhandled JSX expression in React Router component

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router v6:  a missing `return` statement within a component used as an element in a route. This leads to unexpected rendering behavior or silent errors, making it difficult to debug.

## The Bug
The `About` component is missing a `return` statement.  This causes the component to render nothing, even though the JSX is seemingly correctly structured.
